1. In Node_link_Mapping
D.76. After finding all shortest path between source and destination based on path length
How we are selecting a path for the mapping of virtual link on Substrate link
98
97 Decrementing Twice why ?? confusing



2.  in Entropy
***# Looks like wrong values are not matching no need to multiply with e for natural log Corrected
Check "nvalue" values are printing one extra time for both VNR-12 but 13and PN-28 but 29

Weights values not matching
# Weights are not printing the right value  Even we can print negative value also but not displaying

  in Entropy
  line 63 and 64 need to perform over all sum of Pij*LN(Pij) for each attribute

3. Eigen centrality is not printing write value first iteration is right but remaining is wrong

4. in Betweenness centrality
69
print the VNR or SN of which we are printing the node

5. Include pickle file for readning data

6. Mapping will chekck
